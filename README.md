# DSE230 Final Project by Christina Nguyen and Steven Cozine
Final Project for DSE230 - Spring 2021

## Project Data Set
Individual household electric power consumption Data Set from UCI Machine Learning 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption

## Project Description
To use scalable analytic platforms like Dask and Pyspark paired with Hadoop to compute basic machine learning processes. 

For our project we will be using Dask as the primary scalable analytic platform as there are many similar libraries with sklearn and it seems to perform a bit faster compared to Pyspark.

### Hardware used
This project's scope will be limited to our two personal laptops: Dell XPS 13 9360 with Ubuntu VM (Intel i7, 8 GB ram) and Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition (Intel i7, 16 GB ram).

### Software used
[Versions of the libraries we will be using for the Jupyter notebooks]
